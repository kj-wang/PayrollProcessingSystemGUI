## Payroll Processing System

Used to process the payments to the employees in a company. For simplicity, the system will not process the possible deduction items in the paychecks.

Functions include adding/removing an employee, calculating the payments, printing the earning statements, and managing the working hours of the part-time employees.

The system maintains an employee database, which include 3 different types of employees: full time, part-time and management. Note that an employee with a management role is also a full-time employee. Every employee in the database has a profile, including the employee's name, department and the date hired, assuming there are 3 departments in the company: "computer science", "electrical and computer engineering" and "information technology". The payroll is processed every other week. Calculation of the payments are different depending on an employee's employment type.
